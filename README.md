# PFS

Python for subsurface applications. This repository is adapted from a one-week course I taught at ConocoPhillips in Stavanger in May 2025. I would like to thank Mathias Tomasgaard, Karl Simpson, and Dylan Loss for organizing the course. The original material was based on internal ConocoPhillips data, which cannot be shared publicly. To make the course more broadly accessible, I have revised the content to incorporate
publicly available datasets.

## How to follow the course

- Follow the [Python_for_Subsurface.pdf](Python_for_Subsurface.pdf). 

- The code is included in the directory `code`, and the data in the directory `data`. 

- The seismic data is stored in a server, and thus you will need internet connection to download it. 

- The directories `data_analysis`, `factpages`, and `plot_utilities` are packages used in the course.

- Exercises are provided at the end of each chapter. They are intentionally challenging, but they are the best way to practice the material.

## Feedback

I would like to hear your opinion about the course. I made an effort to put together a consistent resource for geoscientists and engineers to learn Python in a short time while performing meaningful subsurface tasks.
