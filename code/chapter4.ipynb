    "## Chapter 4: Control flow\n",
    "\n",
    "Two fundamental concepts form the backbone of computer programs: decision making (yes or no) and repetition. By default, Python executes code sequentially—one line at a time.However, real-world problems often require more flexible control over that flow. Sometimes, we need to check a condition and, depending on the result, execute certain parts of the code either once or multiple times. To make this possible, Python provides tools for conditional and iterative execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conditional execution\n",
    "\n",
    "For conditional execution, Python provides the `if-else` statement. The syntax\n",
    "of this statement is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if expression:\n",
    "    statement_1 \n",
    "else:\n",
    "    statement_2 \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Python evaluates the expression inside the `if` statement. If the condition is true, then `statement_1` is executed; otherwise, `statement_2` runs. Notice that both `if` and `else` statements end with a colon (`:`). This signals the start of a block of code. The code inside these blocks must be indented, typically by four spaces. In Python indentation isn’t just for readability—it’s how the language defines which statements belong to which block. \n",
