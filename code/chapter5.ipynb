    "## Chapter 5: Organizing code\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting code to run is only the beginning. As your projects grow, keeping things organized becomes just as important as making them work. Without structure, your code can quickly turn into spaghetti code—a tangled mess that’s hard to understand, reuse, or build on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good organization is key to writing code that lasts. Whether you’re working solo or with others, how you structure your code affects how easily it can be read, maintained, and improved.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we’ll explore how functions, classes, and modular programming bring clarity and structure to your code, helping you build programs that are both robust and scalable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. It allows you to group related instructions under a single name, so you can run them whenever you need—without repeating yourself. Functions help make your code more organized, readable, and easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax of a function is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def function_name(arg_1, arg_2, ...., arg_n):\n",
    "    statements\n",
    "    return val\n",
    "```\n",
    "`def` is the header of the function, it generates the function object and assigns\n",
    "a name to it. In the parentheses, the input parameters are included. When the function does not have any input parameter, then the parentheses is left empty. After the colon (`:`), the function statements are included. The `return` statement returns a value. If `val` is not specified, the function returns None. Both `val` and the `return` statement are optional.\n",

    "The functions and classes we’ve created so far are only available within the current notebook. Wouldn’t it be convenient to store them in a way that allows us to easily import and use them in any other file when needed? In Python, we can achieve this by organizing them into *modules* and *packages*.\n",

For example, the first Python file we created in this course,`my_first_code.py`, is actually a module. A package is a directory that contains modules or data, along with an initialization file (`__init__.py`), which signals to Python that the directory should be treated as a package.\n",
